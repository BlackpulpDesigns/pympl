Getting Started

First things first, ``pympl`` is written specifically for Python 2.7, so you
should definitely have that running on your system. It has not been tested for
Python 2.6, although it may work there too.

**********
Installing
**********
Per usual Python packages, there are a few ways to install the library.

===
pip
===
Installation via pip is the recommended method::

  pip install pympl

============
easy_install
============
If you prefer ``easy_install``::

  easy_install pympl

=================
github + setup.py
=================
Or, if you want the latest and greatest, you can always clone the repo from
github and manually run ``setup.py``::

  git clone https://github.com/countach74/pympl
  cd pympl
  python setup.py install
